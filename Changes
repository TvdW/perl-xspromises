Revision history for Perl extension Promise::XS:

0.08
- BREAKING CHANGE: finally() now implements ECMAScript’s interface. Toward that
  end, finally() callbacks no longer receive arguments and run in void context.
  Also, any exception thrown in a finally() callback becomes the finally()
  exception’s rejection value. Previously callbacks received the resolution
  or rejection values and ran in list context, and a thrown exception was
  discarded. This is a divergence from preexisting Promise libraries in favor
  of the broader standard.
